Ruby. Its one of the powerfull Language. A little Description of Ruby,Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, general-purpose object-oriented programming language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features. It was also influenced by Eiffel and Lisp. Ruby was first designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Jekyll is the ruby gem which transform your plain text into static websites and blogs, No Databases are required, Just "git":http://www.git-scm.org the posts. (Because I believe in git.). And the good news is We can host our blog using "github pages":http://www.github.com 

So I'm going to do a short tutorial how to deploy your jekyll-blog on github pages. (and all how to install ruby , git on your PC)

Hope this helps. :)
