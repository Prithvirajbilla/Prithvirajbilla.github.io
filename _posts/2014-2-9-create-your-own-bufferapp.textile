h3. What is a bufferapp?


Bufferapp schedules all the content which you find on internet to be posted all day to increase social presence.

h3. Idea


Its simple actually.

Thing you might need.

* [IFTTT account] (https://ifttt.com)
* dropbox account
* server which can run cron jobs

First whenever I want to schedule a post or the content i find on the internet, i save them in text files in the dropbox folder with certain format like 

The filename should be yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM | name_of_the_post.txt

so it is scheduled to be posted on that time.

Now we can create  IFTTT recipes for the posting action.
whenever i send a mail to trigger@ifttt.com the post is posted to fb | twitter | other social media.

What i did was, i was using a free mailgun account. I made a ifttt recipe such that whenever i recieve a new mail from XXX@mailgun.com i'm posting the mail to the social media.

I'm running a cron job for every few seconds.

h3. Other ideas

There exists an IFTTT recipe,
While we store a link (or mark it as view later in pocket) =>  a txt file will be saved to dropbox (but with different name). if we work a way around such that we can save it directly save with the required name we wanted.
that would be great.



And the reason why I'm using mailgun, is sending the email is very simple:
<pre><code>
from conf import *
import requests
def send_simple_message(subject, content):
    return requests.post(
            "https://api.mailgun.net/v2/sandbox7930.mailgun.org/messages",
            auth=("api", mailgunkey),
            data={"from": FROM_MAIL,
                  "to": TO_MAIL,
                  "subject": subject,
                  "text": content})
</code></pre>

Wow, that simple it is.
