title: How I made my own buffer app and the facebook bot
---



This is one of the craziest hack that i have ever done!. I have made my own buffer app (I guess you all know what the bufferapp is) and the facebook bot (Which posts to the fb page, the best and the top links of the HN after few hours).


h3. Hack Recipe:

Things I used for this hack.

<ol>
<li> <a href="http://ifft.com"> IFTTT Account</a> </li>
<li> Dropbox account </li>
<li> Free mailgun account to send emails </li>
<li> <a href="http://mashape.com"> Mashape Account</a> for HN </li>
<li> gmail account </li>
<li> Python </li>
<li> A VPS or something that can cron jobs</li>
</ol>


h3. What i have done for the Buffer App

First the functionality is, I should be able to schedule my fb posting. So, I made a recipe in IFTTT " IF i recieve a mail from 

some email address and then post the email to facebook account".

This is what i have done. I have synced the dropbox folder to the vps. I'm running a cron job on the VPS to check for the new files in the folder every half an hour. If there is a text file then i will read the name of the text file and determine when is it scheduled to post and i will post it accordingly.

<pre><code>
For example Filename will be:
2014-2-13 17:00 | archive.txt
This txt is scheduled to be posted on feb 13, 5 pm;
</code>
</pre>

Then i send the contents of the text file as an email and then it will posted to fb account.

How simple is that!!
