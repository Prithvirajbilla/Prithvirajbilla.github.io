"Setting up a custom domain with Pages":https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages

GitHub Pages allows you to direct a domain name of your choice at your Page.

create a file named CNAME in the root of the project directory.
<pre><code>www.example.com
</code></pre>

Now	Setup the dns. (Instructions on how to change the DNS contact your registrar)

For a domain like <code>example.com</code>, you should use an A record pointing to <code>204.232.175.78</code>:

For sub domain like <code>hello.example.com</code>, you should use an CNAME record with value of the your user pages subdomain.

Now its done!!

It takes atleast 10 hours for DNS changes to take place.
