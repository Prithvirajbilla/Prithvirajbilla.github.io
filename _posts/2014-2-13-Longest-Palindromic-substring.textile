title: Longest palindromic substring
---


Longest palindromic substring.

Given a string for example : "banana"
You have to find the length of the longest palindromic sustring which is 5 in this case.

First I want to discuss about the properties of the palindromes.

Let us suppose that we have a palindrome S.
the left most character is L , the right most character is R and the center of the palindrome is C.
