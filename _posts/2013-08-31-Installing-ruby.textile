title:  Installing Ruby & Gem in Windows / Ubuntu
---


h3. Installing in Ubuntu:

Open a terminal and type the following command:

<pre>
<code>$ sudo apt-get install rubygems build-essential
		(or)
$ sudo apt-get install rubygems</code>
</pre>

This will install the gem in your Ubuntu Pc / Laptop.

Sample Output:

<pre>
<code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
ruby1.8-dev rubygems1.8
Suggested packages:
rubygems-doc
The following NEW packages will be installed:
Do you want to continue? (Y/N)
etc..</code>
</pre>

If you want to install ruby interpretor, open terminal and Type:

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install ruby </code> </pre>

h4. Verify that gem is working

Type the following command:

<pre><code>$ gem env </code></pre>

Now to install jekyll , type the following command

<pre><code>$ sudo gem install jekyll </code></pre>

If you are behind a proxy server as I do, to install gem you have add some environment variable before you start installing the gem.

<pre><code>$ SET HTTP_PROXY=proxyserver:proxyport
$ SET HTTP_PROXY_USER=username
$ SET HTTP_PROXY_PASS=pass
</code></pre>

Yay!! You installed the jekyll gem.

Libraries or packages in ruby are called as gems.

Now you can install other libraries like RedCloth (for textile markup language, etc.);

h3. Installing in Windows:

The simpler way is by installing RAILS FOR WINDOWS, by which gem is installed in your laptop. or you can directly download the zip file from the "ruby gems website":http://rubygems.org/pages/download. and build the gem. (but you need ruby for it.)

So, Download Rails Installer for "windows":http://railsinstaller.org/en and install it.

After installing the Rails, you can find the gem.bat,gem  file in <code>C:\RailsInstaller\Ruby1.9.3\bin</code> .

Add the <code>C:\RailsInstaller\Ruby1.9.3\bin</code> to the system path as show in the figure below.

Now open the command prompt and install all the gems you want.

Now try setting up git.

Git is a distributed version control system released to the public in 2005. The program allows for non-linear development of projects, and can handle large amounts of data effectively by storing it on the local server.

This tutorial will cover two ways to install Git.
In windows, git is installed along with Rails installer.

To configure github. "(follow this tutorial from github)":https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

In ubuntu, first install git and follow the above tutorial to configure github.

To install git in ubuntu, open terminal and type the following command.

<code>sudo apt-get install git-core</code>

After it finishes downloading, you will have Git installed and ready to use.

Now, we have our environment setup and we are ready to go.
